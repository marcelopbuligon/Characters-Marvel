As it had no architecture requirements, Model-View-Presenter with Router pattern was applied in this project. The application was developed aiming at good programming practices and clean code. A service layer is used to make calls in the API and the creation of screens and navigation is done with a Router.
The layout of the project is compatible with iPhones Max models and also of the smallest size up to 4.7 Inches.
